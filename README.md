# Blockchain Music Rights Management Platform

A decentralized platform for managing music intellectual property rights, licensing, and royalty distribution using blockchain technology and smart contracts.

## Overview

The Blockchain Music Rights Management Platform revolutionizes how musical works are registered, licensed, and monetized in the digital age. By leveraging blockchain technology, smart contracts, and NFTs, we provide a transparent, efficient, and automated system for managing music rights and royalties.

## Key Features

### Copyright Registration
- Immutable proof of ownership through blockchain timestamps
- Metadata storage including songwriting credits, publisher info, and rights splits
- Version control and derivative works tracking
- Multi-signature support for works with multiple rightsholders

### Smart Contract Licensing
- Automated license generation and enforcement
- Customizable licensing terms and usage rights
- Territory-specific licensing rules
- Support for different license types (mechanical, sync, performance)
- Real-time license validation

### NFT Integration
- Unique tokens representing individual songs or albums
- Embedded licensing terms and usage rights
- Transferable ownership with complete history
- Fractional ownership support
- Secondary market royalty mechanisms

### Royalty Management
- Automated royalty calculations and distribution
- Real-time streaming data integration
- Smart contract-based payment splitting
- Support for multiple payment currencies and tokens
- Transparent royalty tracking and reporting

## Technical Architecture

### Blockchain Layer
- Ethereum-based smart contracts for core functionality
- IPFS integration for metadata and media storage
- Layer 2 scaling solution for reduced transaction costs
- Cross-chain bridges for multi-blockchain support

### Smart Contracts
```solidity
// Core contracts structure
contracts/
├── Copyright.sol      // Copyright registration and management
├── Licensing.sol      // License creation and enforcement
├── MusicNFT.sol       // NFT implementation for music assets
├── RoyaltyManager.sol // Royalty calculation and distribution
└── StreamingOracle.sol // External data integration
```

### API Integration
- RESTful API for platform interaction
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- OAuth2 authentication
- Rate limiting and security measures

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16+
- Hardhat
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet
- IPFS node (optional)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/music-rights-platform

# Install dependencies
cd music-rights-platform
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Deploy smart contracts
npx hardhat deploy --network <network-name>
```

### Configuration
Create a `.env` file with the following parameters:
```
ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=
PRIVATE_KEY=
IPFS_PROJECT_ID=
IPFS_PROJECT_SECRET=
```

## Usage

### Registering a Musical Work
```javascript
const MusicRights = await ethers.getContractFactory("MusicRights");
const musicRights = await MusicRights.deploy();

await musicRights.registerWork(
  "Song Title",
  "Artist Name",
  ipfsMetadataHash,
  rightsHolders,
  splitPercentages
);
```

### Creating a License
```javascript
await musicRights.createLicense(
  workId,
  licenseeAddress,
  licenseType,
  territory,
  duration,
  terms
);
```

### Minting Music NFTs
```javascript
await musicNFT.mint(
  workId,
  metadata,
  embeddedLicenseTerms
);
```

## API Documentation

### Endpoints

## Security Considerations

- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations
- Regular smart contract audits
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Access control and role-based permissions
- Secure key management
- Anti-spam measures for NFT minting
